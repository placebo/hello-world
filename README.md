# hello-world
this is my first repository
I am brand new to web-development. I've taken the coursecademy on html/css and have messed around a bit on my own. My plan is to become efficent enough to make really interesting and fun websites. After I get a grasp on html/css I want to begin learning JS/PHP/Jquery. I'm here on GitHub for constructive criticism and to join the community and learn as much as I can. This is hobby at this point, but I plan on making this a career in the future.
